# Core Package

The Core Package is the backbone of our Flutter app, encapsulating the essential utilities and services needed across the entire application. This package includes helper functions, logging, network communication, dependency injection (DI), and more, designed to streamline development and maintain a clean, modular codebase.

## Features

- **Helpers**: Commonly used utility functions that simplify complex operations.
- **Logger**: A robust logging system to aid in debugging and monitoring app behavior.
- **Networks**: Efficient network communication setup including API calls management, error handling, and data parsing.
- **DI (Dependency Injection)**: A centralized place for configuring and accessing shared resources and services.

## Getting Started

This section guides you through the setup process and how to use the core functionalities within your app.

### Setup

To integrate the Core Package into your Flutter app, ensure you have the package added to your `pubspec.yaml` file. If you're using a monorepo structure or if this package is part of an internal library, the integration steps might vary.

### Using Helpers

Demonstrate how to use a helper function from the package. Provide a code snippet as an example:

```dart
import 'package:your_core_package/helpers.dart';

void main() {
  var result = Helper.someUtilityFunction();
  print(result);
}
```

### Logging

Explain how to initiate and use the logger for debugging purposes:

```dart
import 'package:your_core_package/logger.dart';

void main() {
  Logger.log('This is a debug log');
}
```

### Networks

Guide on setting up network requests and handling responses:

```dart
import 'package:your_core_package/networks.dart';

void main() async {
  final response = await NetworkService.fetchData('endpoint');
  if (response.isSuccessful) {
    // Handle successful response
  } else {
    // Handle error
  }
}
```

### Dependency Injection (DI)

Instructions for setting up and using DI within the app:

```dart
import 'package:your_core_package/di.dart';

void main() {
  configureDependencies();
  var service = getIt<MyService>();
  service.doSomething();
}
```
