# UI Kit Package

The UI Kit package is a comprehensive design system for our Flutter app, developed with atomic design principles in mind. It meticulously organizes UI components into hierarchical categories: tokens, foundations, atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. This structure enables efficient and consistent implementation of the app's design across different screens and functionalities.

## Features

- **Tokens**: The smallest and most fundamental part of our design system, including colors, typography, spacing, etc.
- **Foundations**: Core design decisions that guide the overall look and feel of the app, building upon the tokens.
- **Atoms**: The basic building blocks of our UI, such as buttons, inputs, and other standalone elements.
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together to form more complex UI components, like form fields with labels and inputs.
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and possibly atoms, forming distinct sections of the app interface, like navigation bars.
- **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout and demonstrate the design's flow.

## Getting Started

This section provides a quick guide on how to incorporate the UI Kit package into your Flutter app.

### Installation

To use the UI Kit in your project, ensure you've added it to your `pubspec.yaml` file. If this package is part of a monorepo or an internal library, the setup might vary slightly.

### Using Components

Here's how you can use an atom component, such as a button, within your app:

```dart
import 'package:ui_kit/atoms/button.dart';

MyButton(
  onPressed: () {
    print('Button pressed');
  },
  child: Text('Click Me'),
);
```

Adapt this snippet to match the actual API of your components.

## Design Principles

Our design system follows a set of core principles that ensure consistency and quality in the design and development of our app:

- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused in different contexts.
- **Scalability**: The system can easily grow and incorporate new designs.
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all components and layouts.
