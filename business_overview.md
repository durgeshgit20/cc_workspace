# Car Crew: Business Model Overview

## 1. Introduction: The Core Business

Car Crew is a service-based business operating in Mumbai, India, that provides a premium, daily car cleaning subscription service. The company's core mission is to professionalize the fragmented and unreliable car cleaning market by offering a solution centered on convenience, quality, transparency, and eco-friendliness. The service is delivered through a hyper-local operational model, targeting dense residential communities.

## 2. Value Proposition

The value delivered to the customer is a multi-faceted solution to the problems associated with traditional car care. This includes:
* **Convenience:** Achieved through a daily, overnight schedule where customers wake up to a clean car without any personal effort.
* **Quality & Hygiene:** Delivered via a paint-safe waterless technology and a strict protocol of using fresh, color-coded microfiber cloths for different parts of each vehicle.
* **Trust & Transparency:** Established by providing photographic "Proof of Service" for every cleaning session.
* **Eco-Friendliness:** Saving thousands of liters of water annually per vehicle.
* **Asset Protection:** Using professional techniques that maintain the car's paint and finish, preserving its resale value.

## 3. Customer Segments

The business targets two distinct customer segments:
1.  **Primary End-Users:** Car owners residing in mid-to-high-end residential societies in Mumbai who value their time, appreciate premium services, and are frustrated with low-quality local cleaners.
2.  **Channel Partners:** The Managing Committees of these residential societies, whose approval is required for Car Crew to operate on their premises.

## 4. Revenue Streams

The business generates revenue through two primary streams:

**1. Recurring Subscriptions:**
This is a monthly recurring revenue (MRR) model where customers subscribe to a package for the daily cleaning service. The pilot pricing is set at ₹1,500/month, with a target price for subsequent buildings of ₹2,500/month.

**2. Premium Add-on Services:**
This consists of one-time, high-margin services offered to the existing subscriber base. These services include:
* Automotive Films like VKOOL PPF & Sun Control Films
* Ceramic Coating
* Premium Polishes
* Automotive Accessories (e.g., 3D MAX Spider Floor Mats, LENSO Wheels, Dash Cams, Seat Covers)

## 5. Service & Operations Model

The day-to-day operations are designed for efficiency and quality control within a hyper-local framework. The cleaning crews operate during the night to ensure all cars are serviced before the morning rush. For each car, the crew follows a standardized operating procedure that includes the specific waterless cleaning technique, the mandatory use of designated microfiber cloths, and the capture of a "Proof of Service" photograph.

The standard subscription package includes:
* Daily exterior wash
* Four interior vacuuming sessions per month
* A "Shine & Sparkle" service covering tyres, trim, and dashboard.

The service is delivered by a trained team of 13 members, with quality control as a key daily activity. Operationally, the model relies on a central location for storing supplies and preparing "nightly kits" for each crew.

## 6. Channels & Customer Relationships

The methods for reaching and maintaining relationships with customers are structured.
* **Primary Sales Channel:** A B2B2C approach, involving direct sales to the Managing Committees of residential societies to gain operational access.
* **Resident Marketing:** Once a society is partnered, marketing to residents is done through approved on-premise channels.
* **Digital Presence:** The company website serves as a digital brochure and credibility tool. The future mobile application is intended as the primary channel for subscribers to manage their service.

Customer relationships are primarily subscription-based and digitally managed, fostering long-term engagement. Direct customer support is provided via dedicated channels like WhatsApp for handling complaints, special requests, and inquiries.

## 7. Key Resources & Cost Structure

The business relies on several key assets and incurs specific costs to operate.

* **Human Capital:** The trained 13-member cleaning crew.
* **Technology:** The mobile app and website.
* **Brand:** The "Car Crew" brand identity.
