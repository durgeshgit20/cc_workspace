CAR CREW: BRAND BOOK & APP DESIGN GUIDELINES

INTRODUCTION: THE CAR CREW PHILOSOPHY

Welcome to the Car Crew brand guide. Our brand is built on a foundation of trust, professionalism, and modern convenience. We are not just cleaning cars; we are providing peace of mind to our customers. Our digital presence, especially our mobile app, must be a seamless extension of this premium experience. Our brand personality is Trustworthy & Reliable, meaning our app should feel solid, secure, and clear in its communication. It is Modern & Tech-Forward, so our app must be clean, contemporary, and intuitive. Our brand is also Premium & Exclusive, so the app's aesthetic should be elegant and uncluttered. We are Convenient & Effortless, which means the app's user experience must be incredibly simple and fast. Finally, our brand is Energetic & Dynamic, which should be reflected in the app's responsive feel.

LOGO USAGE

The Car Crew logo is our primary identifying mark. Its forward-leaning posture signifies progress and speed, while the sharp lines convey precision and professionalism. The full-color primary logo should be used whenever possible, especially on the app's splash screen and header. A single-color version, either in Strong Black or Clean White, should be used where the background does not provide enough contrast. Always maintain a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "C" in "Crew," with no other elements intruding into this space. The logo must not be stretched, distorted, re-colored, or altered in any way.

COLOR PALETTE

Our color palette is simple, bold, and purposeful, designed for high contrast, readability, and a strong brand identity.

The Primary Accent color is Energetic Orange, with a HEX code of #FF6600. This is our action color. It should be used exclusively for primary interactive elements like buttons, important notifications, and key calls-to-action to draw the user's eye.

The Primary Text color is Strong Black, with a HEX code of #000000. This should be used for all primary body text, headlines, and data display to ensure the highest level of readability and a professional tone.

The Background color is Clean White, with a HEX code of #FFFFFF. This is the foundation of our design and should be used for all primary screen backgrounds to create a clean, uncluttered, and premium feel. Ample white space is crucial.

For secondary UI elements, a palette of grays should be used. Light Gray (#E0E0E0) is for subtle lines, card borders, and dividers. Mid Gray (#757575) is for secondary text, like dates and car model info, and for inactive icons. Dark Gray (#F5F5F5) is for the background of text input fields and search bars.

TYPOGRAPHY

Our typography should be clean, modern, and highly legible. The primary typeface is Poppins, available on Google Fonts, chosen for its modern, geometric style and excellent legibility on mobile screens. The usage hierarchy is as follows: Headlines (H1) should use Poppins Bold at 24pt. Sub-Headlines (H2) should use Poppins SemiBold at 18pt. Body Text should use Poppins Regular at 16pt. Buttons and Labels should use Poppins Medium at 16pt. Captions and other sub-text should use Poppins Regular at 14pt.

ICONOGRAPHY

Icons should be simple, clean, and instantly recognizable. They should be in a lightweight, "line icon" style, avoiding heavy, filled-in icons. Active icons should be colored Strong Black, while inactive or secondary icons should be Mid Gray (#757575). All icons used throughout the app must come from a single, consistent icon set, such as Material Icons or Feather Icons.

UI COMPONENTS & INTERACTION DESIGN

This section defines the look and feel of our standard app components.

Primary buttons should have a solid Energetic Orange background with Clean White text and slightly rounded corners. Secondary buttons should be in a ghost style, with an Energetic Orange border and Energetic Orange text on a Clean White background.

Content should be displayed in cards with a subtle Light Gray border or a very light drop shadow to lift them off the Clean White background. Cards should also have slightly rounded corners.

Input fields should have a Dark Gray background with a subtle border that becomes Energetic Orange when the field is active or in focus.

The "Proof of Service" photo is a core feature and should be treated as the hero element on the dashboard and in the history view. Photos should be displayed edge-to-edge in their card container to feel immersive.

Interactions should be smooth and responsive. Tapping a button should provide instant visual feedback. Screen transitions should be a simple, clean fade or a subtle slide, avoiding bouncy or overly playful animations.
